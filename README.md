# Wyvern editor
Wyvern is a long running project, created to provide an open source alternative for Kadokawa-s RPG Maker software.
The editor is capable of creating 2D maps, editing database for a game, managing resources, creating events, playtesting, and more.
All features are created in a way, that can be extended to support multiple game engines.
The editor supports an experimental GUI editor to create dynamic GUI interfaces for managing game data.
